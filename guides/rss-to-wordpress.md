# RSS to WordPress

Great news! WordPress has built in tools to help you export your content from one site, and then import it into another.

## Step 1: Download a copy of your RSS feed

Your platform will allow you to view, and download, a copy of your RSS feed. You can view it in the browser and then save it as an XML file.

## Step 2: Install the RSS Importer

In your WordPress site you can start the import by going to Tools > Import. 
Whilst there isn't a dedicated Squarespace importer - the content you exported has been prepared in such a way that you can use the standard WordPress importer!

Click the 'Install Now' link on the RSS Importer, and then click 'Run Importer' once the installation is complete.

## Step 3: Upload your XML file

Click 'Choose File' then locate and select the XML file that you downloaded in Step 1. Then click 'Upload File and Import'.

## That's it!

The import process may take a little time - but be patient. You'll be notified once it is complete and then you can check your posts to check the content is there!
