# Contentful to WordPress

(Ref: This guide is based on https://developer.wordpress.com/2023/11/30/building-a-contentful-custom-data-migration-to-wordpress/)

Imports from [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/) often need to be handled in a custom way, due to the individualized nature of [how customers design their structures in Contentful’s spaces](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/data-model/) and the format of their export.

This Guide is designed to assist with preparing the contentful exported data to be imported into Wordpress.

## Set `WP_IMPORTING` to be true

It's important to make sure the `WP_IMPORTING` constant is set to true within your WordPress site. This should avoid things like publish notifications, pingbacks, subscription emails, and side effects of an import.

## Export your content from Contentful

The first step is to make sure your content is exported from Contentful. They have [an established export tool provided in their command-line interface](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/cli/import-and-export/) and a [library for making custom exports](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-export) which can be used for this step.

## Inspect and understand the exported data

As noted previously, Contentful’s system leans heavily into configuration over convention, so similar data structures created in two different spaces could have fields named or structured entirely differently. So, it is importnat to understand what there is in the export, and determine what it should be mapped to.

* Post Type: Is the content going to be a Post or Page? Or does a custom post type need to be created within the site to be used?
* Content: Which data should be mapped to the `post_content` in WordPress?
* Content Properties:  If each item has properties, should they be stored in post meta, or should it be a taxonomy? Are they strictly descriptive to utilize on the single post page, or are they something that would be useful to have archive pages for that value generated by WordPress (and therefore be a taxonomy)?
