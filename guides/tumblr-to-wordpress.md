# Tumblr to WordPress

Are you ready to move from Tumblr to WordPress? Let’s cover the basics!

## Step 1: Run the Importer

1. Go to **Tools > Import** in your Dashboard.
2. Choose **Install Now** below Tumblr, and then **Activate Plugin & Run Importer**.

## Step 2: Connect to Tumblr

Follow the instructions specifically. Once you provide your OAuth and Secret Key as detailed and click **Connect to Tumblr**, you’ll be prompted to connect to Tumblr. Follow the steps provided again, and you’ll be on your way to WordPress!

On the next screen, click **“Import this blog”** next to the blog you’re importing from your Tumblr account, and wait.

Sometimes the importer finds an embed it can’t convert. A list of these is included in the import completion email for you to check.

If your Tumblr site has a custom domain (like yourgroovydomain.com instead of automattic.tumblr.com), then you’ll need to disable the custom domain temporarily while the import is processed. You can do this on Tumblr by clicking on **Settings** on the left, choosing the blog you’d like to update on the right, then toggling the **“Use a custom domain”** marker to the off position.
