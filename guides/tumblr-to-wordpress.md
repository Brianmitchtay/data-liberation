## Step 2: Connect to Tumblr

In order to import your Tumblr site we need to create a connection to Tumblr. Follow the instructions specifically on this screen in order to create an oAuth Consumer Key and Secret Key. 

Enter these details in the field provided, and click 'Connect to Tumblr'.

You'll then see a screen which prompts you to 'authorize' the application you just created.

You can click the 'Authorize the Application' link and then on the screen that appears, click the green 'Allow' button.

## Step 3: Import your content

Now that Tubmlr is connected - you'll see a screen which lists your current Tumblr blogs. Click “Import this blog” next to the blog you’re importing from your Tumblr account, and wait.

Sometimes the importer finds an embed it can’t convert. A list of these is included in the import completion email for you to check.

If your Tumblr site has a custom domain (like yourgroovydomain.com instead of automattic.tumblr.com), then you’ll need to disable the custom domain temporarily while the import is processed. You can do this on Tumblr by clicking on Settings on the left, choosing the blog you’d like to update on the right, then toggling the “Use a custom domain” marker to the off position.

Please remember that if you have any trouble with the import process - you can [ask for assistance in the forums](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/tumblr-importer/).
