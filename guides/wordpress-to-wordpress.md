# WordPress to WordPress

WordPress includes an import tool designed specifically for importing content from another WordPress blog.

1. In your WordPress site, select **Tools > Import** on the left nav of the admin screen.
2. Under “WordPress,” if you haven’t already installed the importer, click “Install Now.”
3. Click the “Run Importer” link.
4. Click “Choose File” and navigate to the WXR file exported from your source.
5. Click “Upload file and import.”

You will first be asked to map the authors in this export file to users on the blog. For each author, you may choose to map to an existing user on the blog or to create a new user. WordPress will then import each of the posts, comments, and categories contained in the uploaded file into your blog. In addition, you can import attachments by checking the “Download and import file attachments” option.
