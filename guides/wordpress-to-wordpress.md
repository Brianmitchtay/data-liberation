# WordPress to WordPress

Great news! WordPress has built in tools to help you export your content from one site, and then import it into another.

## Export your site

The first step is to export your content from the source site (the existing site you want to move). You can do that by going to **Tools > Export** in the admin menu of your site.

By default the tool will export *all* content from your site - including posts, pages, comments, custom fields, terms, navigation menus, and custom posts. 

**It is important to note that it is necessary to select this option in order for media attached to your content to be imported in the next step.**

Selecting one of the other options will export *only* that content from the site. It will also introduce further options to filter *which* items of content to include. [You can find out more about these filtering options in the WordPress Support Documentation](https://wordpress.org/documentation/article/tools-export-screen/#filters-and-other-options).

When the 'Download Export File' button is clicked, the export will be prepared and then downloaded as `WXR` file - which is an XML file that WordPress uses for importing and exporting content. 

## Import to your new site

In your *new* site you can start the import by going to Tools > Import.
